I'm an colombian economist with a master in economics and a master in applied social data science. Currenty working at the [International Innequalities Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-inequalities) at the London School of Economics and Pol√≠tical Science. I hold experience in public policy, data analysis focused mostly in the educational sector.
üìò Currently, I'm interested in developing new data science skills in order to undertake research projects related to economics of education and human capital.
