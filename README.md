### About me

I'm an colombian economist with a master in economics and experience in public policy, data analysis focused mostly in the educational sector. Currently I'm studying a [Master in Applied Social Data Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2023/MSc-Applied-Social-Data-Science) at the London School of Economics and Political Science. 

üìò Currently, I'm interested in developing new data science skills in order to undertake research projects related to economics of education and human capital.
üßê I'm convinced that data can provide solutions for educational problems and specifically be used as a tool to make design better public policies and improve educational outcomes
